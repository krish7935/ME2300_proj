# Airfoil Design and Analysis – ME2300 Project

This repository contains the STL models and CFD simulation results for our Manufacturing Processes (ME2300) project at IIT Madras.

## Overview

We designed and analyzed an airfoil based on the **NACA 4412** profile to study aerodynamic behavior and validate lift characteristics through both analytical and simulation methods.

## Key Components

- **3D Modeling**  
  Designed using **Fusion 360**, the airfoil was modeled accurately with reference to NACA 4412 coordinates and exported in STL and STEP formats.

- **CFD Analysis**  
  Conducted using **SimScale** on a scaled-down model (3.96 cm × 12.5 cm) at a 5° angle of attack under turbulent flow conditions using the **k-omega SST** model.  
  Results showed lift generation sufficient to support ~10 kg.

- **3D Printing**  
  The model was printed in two 12.5 cm segments (scaled 10:1) due to printer constraints, providing a physical prototype for demonstration.
